# Notbot-Chatbot-for-Internship-tasks
This is an intership task by Notbot

Proceeding with my own custom message template was seemed impossible because meta was not accepting my custom message templates. So I just had to go with this one.
Since I took up this task , I wanted to complete it any ways. And I got this way of approach for automated messages using pabbly connect platform where No coding is used and a limited number of automated messages are allowed to use.

I wish you would consider this task for which I spent a total of 2 days and 1 night to understand and implement.
